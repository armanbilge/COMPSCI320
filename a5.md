1.  * **Yes**. $\left\{1,3\right\}, \left\{2,2\right\}, \left\{4\right\}$
    * **No**. $\sum{s_i} > kC$
    * **Yes**. $\left\{4,7,9\right\}, \left\{2,2,8,8\right\}, \left\{1,2,8,9\right\}, \left\{5,5,10\right\}$
    * **Yes**. $\left\{4,7,19,70\right\}, \left\{6,25,69\right\}, \left\{39,58\right\}, \left\{21,22,57\right\}$
    * **Yes**. $\left\{1,1,1,1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6,6,6,6,7,10,17,20\right\}, \left\{9,13,17,19,20,23\right\}$

2.  Let $S = \left\{s_1,\ldots,s_n\right\}$ be a set of $n$ integers.

    If $\sum{s_i} \equiv 1 \pmod 2$ then $S$ is clearly a no instance to the \textsc{Partition} problem.

    Otherwise, $S$ is a yes instance to the \textsc{Partition} problem iff $S$ is a yes instance to the \textsc{Bin Packing} problem with $C = \frac{1}{2}\sum{s_i}$ and $k = 2$.

    **Proof**. Consider a solution $S_1, S_2$ to the \textsc{Partition} problem on $S$.
    Then $$\sum_{s \in S_1}{s} = \sum_{s \in S_2}{s} = \frac{1}{2}\sum{s_i}$$ by definition.
    Therefore $S_1, S_2$ is also a solution to the \textsc{Bin Packing} problem on $S$ with $C = \frac{1}{2}\sum{s_i}$ and $k = 2$.

    Consider a solution $S_1, S_2$ to the \textsc{Bin Packing} problem on $S$ with $C = \frac{1}{2}\sum{s_i}$ and $k = 2$.
    Let $$a = \sum_{s \in S_1}{s} \text{ and } b = \sum_{s \in S_2}{s}.$$
    Then we have $a \leq C$ and $b \leq C$ by definition.
    Noting that $a + b = \sum{s_i} = 2C$, it follows that $a = b = C$.
    Therefore $S_1, S_2$ is also a solution to the \textsc{Partition} problem.

    It immediately follows that $S$ is a no instance to the \textsc{Partition} problem iff $S$ is a no instance to the \textsc{Bin Packing} problem with $C = \frac{1}{2}\sum{s_i}$ and $k = 2$.

    $\therefore \text{\textsc{Partition}} \leq_p \text{\textsc{Bin Packing}}$

3.  **TODO**

4.  Let $G = \left(V, E\right)$ be an edge-weighted digraph.
    Define $-G$ to be the graph $G$ with every edge weight negated.

    Then $\left(G, s, t, c\right)$ is a yes instance to the \textsc{Longest Path} problem iff $\left(-G, s, t, -c\right)$ is a yes instance to the \textsc{Shortest Path} problem.

    **Proof**. $S = \left(s,\ldots,t\right)$ is a simple path of length $l$ in $G$ iff $S$ is a simple path of length $-l$ in $-G$.
    $S$ is a solution to the \textsc{Longest Path} on $\left(G, s, t, c\right)$ iff $l \geq c \iff -l \leq -c$ iff $S$ is a solution to the \textsc{Shortest Path} on $\left(-G, s, t, -c\right)$.

    It immediately follows that $\left(G, s, t, c\right)$ is a no instance to the \textsc{Longest Path} problem iff $\left(-G, s, t, -c\right)$ is a no instance to the \textsc{Shortest Path} problem.

    $\therefore \text{\textsc{Longest Path}} \leq_p \text{\textsc{Shortest Path}}$

    \textsc{Shortest Path} is NP-complete because it is in NP (a solution can be verified in polynomial time) and NP-hard, given that we reduced \textsc{Longest Path} (also NP-complete) to it.
