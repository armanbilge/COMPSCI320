1. (a) Let $\mathcal O = \left[P_{j_1}, \ldots, P_{j_m}\right]$ be an optimal list of programs and let $A = \left[P_{i_1}, \ldots, P_{i_k}\right]$ be the list created by the algorithm.
       Assume that the programs are ordered by increasing $s_i$.

           Let $\mathcal P\left(r\right) \equiv \left(\sum_{l=1}^{r} s_{i_l} \leq \sum_{l=1}^{r} s_{j_l}\right)$.

           $\mathcal P\left(1\right)$ is clearly true because $P_{i_1}$ is the program with the smallest size by the greedy property.

           Assume that $\mathcal P\left(r\right)$ is true.
           Note that $P_{i_{r+1}}$ is the programs with the $\left(r+1\right)$th smallest size by the greedy property.


           Therefore, by induction $\mathcal P\left(r\right)$ is true for all $1 \leq r \leq \min{\left(k, m\right)}$.

           Assume that $A$ is not optimal such that $m \geq k$.
           We know that $\sum_{l=1}^k s_{i_l} \leq \sum_{l=1}^k s_{j_l}$, so there is at least one more program

    (b) Let $D = 4$ and consider programs $P_1, P_2, P_3$ with sizes $s_1 = 3, s_2 = 2, s_3 = 2$.

        A greedy algorithm that selects programs in order of decreasing $s_i$ would create the list of programs $A = \left[P_1\right]$, with $D - s_1 = 1$.
        However, an optimal list of programs $\mathcal O = \left[P_2, P_3\right]$ has $D - (s_2 + s_3) = 0$.

        Therefore, the greedy algorithm does not necessarily use as much of the capacity of the disk as possible.

4. Candidates: elements.

       Partial solution: sorted list of first $n$ smallest elements.

       Selection: append smallest unsorted element to sorted list.

       Rejection: never.

5. Consider the rational number $r = \frac{m}{n}$ for $m,n \in \mathbb N$.

    The algorithm clearly terminates when $m = 1$ because then $r$ is an Egyptian fraction.

    Assume that the algorithm terminates when $1 \leq m \leq k$.
    Note that the next Egyptian fraction in the sum is $\frac{1}{\lceil\frac{1}{r}\rceil}$ by the greedy property.
    Consider the case where $m = k+1$.
    Then the next iteration of the algorithm gives
    \begin{align*}
        r - \frac{1}{\lceil\frac{1}{r}\rceil} &= \frac{k+1}{n} - \frac{1}{\lceil\frac{n}{k+1}\rceil} \\
        &= \frac{\left(k+1\right)\lceil\frac{n}{k+1}\rceil - n}{n \lceil\frac{n}{k+1}\rceil} \\
        &= \frac{\left(k+1\right)\left(\lfloor\frac{n-1}{k+1}\rfloor + 1\right) - n}{n \lceil\frac{n}{k+1}\rceil} \\
        &\leq \frac{\left(k+1\right)\left(\frac{n-1}{k+1} + 1\right) - n}{n \lceil\frac{n}{k+1}\rceil} \\
        &= \frac{k}{n \lceil\frac{n}{k+1}\rceil} \\
    \end{align*}
    The recursion of the algorithm on this new fraction will terminate by our assumption, so the algorithm will terminate when $m = k+1$.

    Therefore, by induction the algorithm will terminate for all $m \in \mathbb N$; i.e., it will always terminate.
