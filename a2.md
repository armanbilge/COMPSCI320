1. (a) Let $\mathcal O = \left[P_{j_1}, \ldots, P_{j_m}\right]$ be an optimal list of programs and let $A = \left[P_{i_1}, \ldots, P_{i_k}\right]$.
       Assume that the programs are ordered by increasing $s_i$.

           Let $\mathcal P\left(r\right) \equiv \left(s_{i_r} \leq s_{j_r}\right)$.

           $\mathcal P\left(1\right)$ is clearly true because $P_{i_1}$ is the program with the smallest size.

           Assume that $\mathcal P\left(r\right)$ is true.

    (b) Let $D = 4$ and consider programs $P_1, P_2, P_3$ with sizes $s_1 = 3, s_2 = 2, s_3 = 2$.

        A greedy algorithm that selects programs in order of decreasing $s_i$ would create the list of programs $A = \left[P_1\right]$, with $D - s_1 = 1$.
        However, an optimal list of programs $\mathcal O = \left[P_2, P_3\right]$ has $D - (s_2 + s_3) = 0$.

        Therefore, the greedy algorithm does not necessarily use as much of the capacity of the disk as possible.
