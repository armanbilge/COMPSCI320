1. (a) Let $\mathcal O = \left[P_{j_1}, \ldots, P_{j_m}\right]$ be an optimal list of programs and let $A = \left[P_{i_1}, \ldots, P_{i_k}\right]$ be the list created by the algorithm.
       Assume that the programs are ordered by increasing $s_i$, such that $s_{i_r} \leq s_{j_r}$ for all $1 \leq r \leq \min{\left(k, m\right)}$ by the greedy property.

           Assume that $A$ is not optimal such that $m > k$.
           We find that $$\sum_{r=1}^k s_{i_r} \leq \sum_{r=1}^k s_{j_r} < \sum_{r=1}^m s_{j_r} \leq D,$$ so there is at least one more program that may have been added to the list by the algorithm.
           But the algorithm would not have stopped while it was still possible to add programs.
           Given this contradiction, we conclude that $A$ is optimal.

    (b) Let $D = 4$ and consider programs $P_1, P_2, P_3$ with sizes $s_1 = 3, s_2 = 2, s_3 = 2$.

        A greedy algorithm that selects programs in order of decreasing $s_i$ would create the list of programs $A = \left[P_1\right]$, with $D - s_1 = 1$.
        However, an optimal list of programs $\mathcal O = \left[P_2, P_3\right]$ has $D - (s_2 + s_3) = 0$.

        Therefore, the greedy algorithm does not necessarily use as much of the capacity of the disk as possible.

2. Suppose that we want to return 48 pence in change.
    An optimal solution consists of 2 florins (2 coins total).
    However, the greedy algorithm would produce 1 half-crown, 1 shilling, and 1 sixpence (3 coins total).
    Therefore, the greedy algorithm does not necessarily return an optimal solution.

3. An optimal solution will never contain more than $p - 1$ coins of denomination $p^{k-1}$ for $1 \leq k \leq n$.
    This is because every set of $p$ coins of denomination $p^{k-1}$ in a solution can be replaced with a single coin of denomination $p^k$, thus rendering the solution non-optimal.

    Furthermore, the optimal solution is unique because all solutions are connected by incrementing and decrementing the quantities of coins by multiples of powers of $p$.
    Thus there is only one solution that satisfies the necessary property of an optimal solution, making it a sufficient property for the optimal solution.

    The greedy algorithm maximises the occurrence of the coin of the largest denomination less than the total and then recurses on the remaining difference.
    In this way it guarantees that the sufficient property for the optimal solution is met and therefore always produces the optimal solution.

4. The selection sort algorithm produces a sorted list of elements by greedily selecting the smallest unsorted element and appending it to the list of sorted elements.

    Candidates: elements.

    Partial solution: sorted list of elements.

    Selection: append smallest unsorted element to sorted list.

    Rejection: never.

5. Consider the rational number $r = \frac{m}{n}$ for $m, n \in \mathbb N$ with $1 \leq m < n$.

    The algorithm terminates when $m = 1$ because then $r$ is an Egyptian fraction.

    Assume that the algorithm terminates when $1 \leq m \leq k$.
    Note that the next Egyptian fraction in the sum is $\frac{1}{\lceil\frac{1}{r}\rceil}$ by the greedy property.
    Consider the case where $m = k+1$.
    Then the next iteration of the algorithm gives
    \begin{align*}
        r - \frac{1}{\lceil\frac{1}{r}\rceil} &= \frac{k+1}{n} - \frac{1}{\lceil\frac{n}{k+1}\rceil} \\
        &= \frac{\left(k+1\right)\lceil\frac{n}{k+1}\rceil - n}{n \lceil\frac{n}{k+1}\rceil} \\
        &= \frac{\left(k+1\right)\left(\lfloor\frac{n-1}{k+1}\rfloor + 1\right) - n}{n \lceil\frac{n}{k+1}\rceil} \\
        &\leq \frac{\left(k+1\right)\left(\frac{n-1}{k+1} + 1\right) - n}{n \lceil\frac{n}{k+1}\rceil} \\
        &= \frac{k}{n \lceil\frac{n}{k+1}\rceil} \\
    \end{align*}
    The recursion of the algorithm on this new fraction will terminate by our initial assumption, so the algorithm will terminate when $m = k+1$.

    Therefore, by induction the algorithm will terminate for all $m \in \mathbb N$; i.e., it will always terminate.
